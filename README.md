# Gen-Z-Executive-Excel-Dashboard

This one is my internship project I have to present key insights to executive on Gen-Z career aspiration.

Developed an interactive Career Aspiration Dashboard based on survey data from 124,708 Gen Z respondents during my internship at KultureHire.

Visualized key insights, such as top career choices (e.g., Data Analyst, Product Manager), organizational preferences (e.g., Startups, Large Companies), and salary expectations.

Highlighted work-related frustrations such as unclear goals and unsupportive managers.

Used Excel to create pivot tables, charts, and dynamic visualizations.

The dashboard provided valuable insights into the career and workplace expectations of the emerging Gen Z workforce.

Tools Used: Excel for data visualization and analysis.
