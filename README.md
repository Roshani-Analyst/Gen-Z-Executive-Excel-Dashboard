This project presents a comprehensive Executive Dashboard designed to analyze the career aspirations and work preferences of Gen Z professionals. Built using Excel, the dashboard leverages pivot tables, charts, and slicers to provide dynamic insights into the factors shaping Gen Z's professional goals, work-life alignment, and preferences for company missions.

- Developed an interactive Career Aspiration Dashboard based on survey data from 124,708 Gen Z respondents during my internship at KultureHire.

- Visualized key insights, such as top career choices (e.g., Data Analyst, Product Manager), organizational preferences (e.g., Startups, Large Companies), and salary expectations.

- Highlighted work-related frustrations such as unclear goals and unsupportive managers.

- Used Excel to create pivot tables, charts, and dynamic visualizations.

- The dashboard provided valuable insights into the career and workplace expectations of the emerging Gen Z workforce.

- Tools Used: Excel for data visualization and analysis.
